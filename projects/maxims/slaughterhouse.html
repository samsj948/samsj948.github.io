    <p>He was doing nothing less now, he thought, then prescribing corrective lenses for
Earthling souls. So many of those souls were lost and wretched, Billy believed, because
they could not see as well as his little green friends on Tralfamadore.</p>
 <p>'Don't lie to me, Father,' said Barbara. 'I know perfectly well you heard me when I
called.' This was a fairly pretty girl, except that she had legs like an Edwardian grand
piano. Now she raised hell with him about the letter in the paper. She said he was making
a laughing stock of himself and everybody associated with him.</p>
 <p>'Father, Father, Father,' said Barbara, 'what are we going to do with you? Are you
going to force us to put you where your mother is?' Billy's mother was still alive. She was
in bed in an old people's home called Pine Knoll on the edge of Ilium.</p>
<p> 'What is it about my letter that makes you so mad?' Billy wanted to know.</p>
<p> 'It's all just crazy. None of it's true! '</p>
 <p>'It's all true. ' Bill's anger was not going to rise with hers. He never got mad at
anything. He was wonderful that way.</p>
<p> 'There is no such planet as Tralfamadore.'</p>
<p>'It can't be detected from Earth, if that's what you mean,' said Billy. 'Earth can't be
detected from Tralfamadore, as far as that goes. They're both very small. They're very far
apart.'</p>
 <p>'Where did you get a crazy name like "Tralfamadore?"'</p>
 <p>'That's what the creatures who live there call it.</p>
 <p>'Oh God,' said Barbara, and she turned her back on him. She celebrated frustration by
clapping her hands. 'May I ask you a simple question?'</p>
<p> 'Of course.'</p>
<p> 'Why is it you never mentioned any of this before the airplane crash?'
 'I didn't think the time was ripe.'</p>
<p> And so on. Billy says that he first came unstuck in time in 1944, long before his trip to
Tralfamadore. The Tralfamadorians didn't have anything to do with his coming unstuck
They were simply able to give him insights into what was really going on.
 Billy first came unstuck while the Second World War was in progress. Billy was a
chaplain's assistant in the war. A chaplain's assistant is customarily a figure of fun in the
American Army. Billy was no exception. He was powerless to harm the enemy or to help
his friends. In fact, he had no friends. He was a valet to a preacher, expected no
promotions or medals, bore no arms, and had a meek faith in a loving Jesus which most
soldiers found putrid.</p>
