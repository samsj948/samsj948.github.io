   <p>Have you been approached by a tall man in a bowler hat?</p>
   <p>What?</p>
   <p>Hey. hey, I'll ask the questions here.</p>
   <p> Okay, goodbye.</p>
   <p> All right, didn't want to pull rank on you, but you forced my hand.

   <p>The what?</p>
   <p>Time Continuum Task Force. I'm here to protect you.</p>
  <p> Now, tall man, bowler hat, approached you?</p>
  <p>No, why?</p>

<p>- A time machine.</p>

<p>- A what?</p>

<p>I've tracked him to this time, and my informants say he's after you.</p>

<p>Me? Why me?</p>

<p>The boys back at HQ haven't figured out a motive yet. And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters. "</p>
<p>I know what HQ means.</p>

Just worry about your little science gizmo and leave the "perp" to me.
- And by "perp," I mean...</p>

<p>- I know what it means!</p>

<p>Okay, Mr Smarty-pants. Bowler Hat Guy!</p>

<p>My frogs!</p>

kid with science project.</p>

<p>Dude, you almost busted

my solar system!</p>

<p>My frogs! They're getting away!

Got you! That's the last of them.</p>

<p>Annoying little girl,

I don't have time for this.

I'm on a very important...</p>

<p>Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.</p>
