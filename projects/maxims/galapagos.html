   		<p>The price tag was still stapled to the hem of Wait's crackling new shirt,
   		and Ortiz, very politely and in good English, told him so.</p>
   		<p>"Oh?" said Wait. He knew the tag was there, and he wanted it to remain there. 
   		But he went through a charade of self-mocking embarrassment and seemed about to pluck
   		off the tag. But then, as though overwhelmed by sorrow he was trying to flee from, appeared to forget all about it. </p>
   		<p>Wait was a fisherman, and the price tag was his bait, a way of encouraging strangers to speak to him, to say in one way or another
   		what Ortiz had said "Excuse me, Senor, but I can't help noticing-"</p>
   		<p>Wait was registered at the hotel under the name on his bogus Canadian passport,
   		which was Willard Flemming. He was a supremely successful swindler.</p>
   		<p>Ortiz himself was in no danger from him, but an unescorted woman who looked as though she had a little money, and who was without a husband and 
   		past childbearing, surely would have been. Wait had so far courted and married 
   		seventeen such persons-- and then cleaned out their jewelry boxes and safe deposit boxes and bank accounts and disappeared.</p>
