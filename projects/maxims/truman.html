    <p>CHRISTOF's voice booms over the now calm ocean.</p>

                         <p> CHRISTOF<br>
                Truman!</p>

    <p> TRUMAN drops the handle as if his hand has been burned.  He 
     looks all about him.</p>

                         <p> CHRISTOF (O.C.)<br>
                You can speak.  I can hear you.</p>

    <p> Truman takes a moment to overcome his fear and astonishment.</p>

                        <p>  TRUMAN<br>
                Who are you?</p>

                       <p>   CHRISTOF<br>
                I'm the creator.</p>

   <p>  Truman looks up to the "heavens".</p>

                        <p>  TRUMAN<br>
                The creator of what?</p>

                         <p> CHRISTOF (O.C.)<br>
                A show - that gives hope and joy and
                inspiration to millions.</p>

                         <p> TRUMAN<br>
                     (incredulous)
                A show.  Then who am I?</p>

                        <p>  CHRISTOF (O.C.)<br>
                You're the star.</p>

   <p>  Truman struggles to take it all in.</p>

                         <p> TRUMAN<br>
                Nothing was real.</p>

                         <p> CHRISTOF<br>
                You were real.  That's what made you
                you so good to watch.</p>

    <p> Truman takes out the drenched picture of Sylvia, recalling 
     her words at the beach.</p>

                         <p> TRUMAN<br>
                     (to himself)
                "The eyes are everywhere."</p>


    <p> INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.</p>

   <p>  CHRISTOF picks up a slim, flat monitor.  He swivels in his 
     chair and gazes intently at the image of Truman he now holds in
     his hands.</p>

                         <p> CHRISTOF<br>
                Listen to me, Truman--</p>

    <p> On the screen, Truman again reaches for the door handle.</p>


   <p>  EXT.  CYCLORAMA.  DAY.</p>

    <p> We focus on TRUMAN's hand.  CHRISTOF's voice echoes across 
     the water.</p>

                       <p>   CHRISTOF<br>
                You can leave if you want.  I won't try
                to stop you.  But you won't survive out
                there.  You don't know what to do,
                where to go.</p>
