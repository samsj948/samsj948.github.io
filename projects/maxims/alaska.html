		<p> I wish my parents had let me pick my name. But they went ahead and picked the only name firstborn male
		Halters have had for a century. "But why Alaska?" I asked her.</p>
		
		<p>She smiled with the right side of her mouth. "Well, later, I found out what it means. It's from an Aleut word,
		Alyeska. It means 'that which the sea breaks against,' and I love that. But at the time, I just saw Alaska up there.
		And it was big, just like I wanted to be. And it was damn far away from Vine Station, Alabama, just like I wanted
		to be."</p>
		
		<p>I laughed. "And now you're all grown up and fairly far away from home," I said, smiling. "So congratulations."
		She stopped the head bobbing and let go of my (unfortunately sweaty) hand.</p>
		
 		<p>"Getting out isn't that easy," she said seriously, her eyes on mine like I knew the way out and wouldn't tell her.
		And then she seemed to switch conversational horses in midstream. "Like after college, know what I want to do?
		Teach disabled kids. I'm a good teacher, right? Shit, if I can teach you precalc, I can teach anybody. Like maybe
		kids with autism."</p>
	
 		<p>She talked softly and thoughtfully, like she was telling me a secret, and I leaned in toward her, suddenly
		overwhelmed with the feeling that we must kiss, that we ought to kiss right now on the dusty orange couch with
		its cigarette burns and its decades of collected dust. And I would have: I would have kept leaning toward her until
		it became necessary to tilt my face so as to miss her ski-slope nose, and I would have felt the shock of her so-soft
		lips. I would have. But then she snapped out of it.</p>
		
		<p>"No," she said, and I couldn't tell at first whether she was reading my kiss-obsessed mind or responding to
		herself out loud. She turned away from me, and softly, maybe to herself, said, "Jesus, I'm not going to be one of
		those people who sits around talking about what they're gonna do. I'm just going to do it. Imagining the future is
		a kind of nostalgia."</p>
		
 		<p>"Huh?" I asked.</p>
 		
 		<p>"You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you'll escape it one day, and how awesome
		it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the
		present."</p>
		
 		<p>I guess that made sense. I had imagined that life at the Creek would be a bit more exciting than it was—in reality,
		there'd been more homework than adventure—but if I hadn't imagined it, I would never have gotten to the Creek
		at all.</p>
		
 		<p>She turned back to the TV, a commercial for a car now, and made a joke about Blue Citrus needing its own car
		commercial. Mimicking the deep-voiced passion of commercial voice-overs, she said, "It's small, it's slow, and it's
		shitty, but it runs. Sometimes. Blue Citrus: See Your Local Used-Car Dealer." But I wanted to talk more about her
		and Vine Station and the future.</p>
		
		<p>"Sometimes I don't get you," I said.</p>
		
 		<p>She didn't even glance at me. She just smiled toward the television and said, "You never get me. That's the whole
		point."</p>
