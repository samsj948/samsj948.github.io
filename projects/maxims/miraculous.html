   <p> On land, the old fisherman stopped to
light a pipe, and then, with the pipe clenched
between his teeth, he walked home, carrying
Edward atop his left shoulder as if he were a
conquering hero. The 'sherman balanced him
there, placing a callused hand at Edward’s
back. He talked to him in a soft, low voice as
they walked.</p>
<p>“You’ll like Nellie, you will,” said the old
man. “She’s had her sadness, but she’s an allright girl.”</p>
<p>Edward looked at the small town
blanketed in dusk: a jumble of buildings
huddled together, the ocean stretching out in
front of it all; and he thought that he would
like anything and anybody that was not at the
bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>“Hello, Lawrence,” called a woman from
the front of a shop. “What have you got?”</p>
<p>“Fresh catch,” said the fisherman, “fresh
rabbit from the sea.” He lifted his cap to the
lady and kept walking.</p>

<p>“There you are, now,” said the fisherman.
He took the pipe out of his mouth and pointed
with the stem of it at a star in the purpling
sky. “There’s your North Star right there. Don’t
never have to be lost when you know where
that fellow is.”</p>
<p>Edward considered the brightness of the
small star.
Do they all have names? he wondered.</p>
<p>“Listen at me,” said the fisherman,
“talking to a toy. Oh, well. Here we are, then.”
And with Edward still on his shoulder, the
fisherman walked up a stone-lined path and
into a little green house.</p>
<p>“Look here, Nellie,” he said. “I’ve brought
you something from the sea.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want nothing from the sea,” came
a voice.</p>
<p>“Aw, now, don’t be like that, Nell.Come
and see, then.”</p>
<p>An old woman stepped out of the kitchen,
wiping her hands on an apron. When she saw
Edward, she dropped the apron and clapped
her hands together and said, “Oh, Lawrence,
you brung me a rabbit.”</p>
<p>“Direct from the sea,” said Lawrence. He
took Edward off his shoulder and stood him
up on the floor and held on to his hands and
made him take a deep bow in the direction of
Nellie.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Nellie, “here.” She clapped her
hands together again and Lawrence passed
Edward to her.</p>
<p>Nellie held the rabbit out in front of her
and looked him over from tip to toe. She
smiled. “Have you ever in your life seen
anything so fine?” she said.</p>
