    <div class="conversation">
  <p> When he gave us our air-rifles Atticus wouldn’t teach us to shoot. Uncle Jack
instructed us in the rudiments thereof; he said Atticus wasn’t interested in guns. Atticus
said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know you’ll go
after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to
kill a mockingbird.”</p>
 <p>That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I
asked Miss Maudie about it.</p>
 <p>“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music for us
to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they don’t do one
thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”
</p> <p>“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”</p>
<p> “Been here longer than the town.”</p>
<p> “Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children
around here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so are
you and Atticus.”</p>
<p> “I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around yet, am
I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to burn down that
old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re right, Jean Louise, this
is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around young folks much, have you?”
 </p><p>“Yessum, at school.”</p>
 <p>“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the benefit of
your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite different.”</p>
 <p>“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”</p>
 <p>“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”</p>
 <p>“What can he do?”</p>
 <p>“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”</p>
 <p>“Shoot…”</p>
 <p>“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the
Landing when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both sides of
the river.”</p>
<p> “Good Lord, Miss Maudie, Jem and me beat him all the time.”</p>
 <p>“It’s about time you found out it’s because he lets you. Did you know he can play a
Jew’s Harp?”</p>
 <p>This modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him.
 “Well…” she said.</p>
<p> “Well, what, Miss Maudie?”
 “Well nothing. Nothing—it seems with all that you’d be proud of him. Can’t everybody
play a Jew’s Harp. Now keep out of the way of the carpenters. You’d better go home, I’ll
be in my azaleas and can’t watch you. Plank might hit you.” </p>
