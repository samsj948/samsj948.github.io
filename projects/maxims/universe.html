    <div class="conversation">
    <p>Moonlight becomes sunshine as the camera reveals the two lovers coiled together under a tangle of sheets.
    The door opens and Max enters, waking them both.</p>
    <p>MAX<br>
    Oh. So that's the way it is.</p>
    <p>JUDE<br>
    That's the way it is<p>
    <p>MAX<br>
    Speaking as a brother, I think she could do better</p>
    <p>LUCY<br>
    Get out of here, Max</p>
    <p>MAX<br>
    Look, as blissful as you are in the throes of young love, we have a problem with Prudence.</p>
    <p>Sadie raps her knuckles on a locked door. Max, Jude, and Lucy stand behind her.</p>
    <p>SADIE<br>
    Prudence, come on, sweet-pea, we all love you</p>
    <p>LUCY<br>
    How long has she been in there?</p>
    <p>SADIE<br>
    She was there when I woke up</p>
    <p>MAX<br>
    I think she's hing ip on me</p>
   <p>SADIE<br>
   Dear Prudence, Won't you come out to play?
   Dear Prudence, Greet the brand new day
   The sun is ip, the sky is blue
   It's beautiful and so are you
   Dear Prudence Won't you come out to play?</p>
   <p>JUDE<br>
   Dear Prudence, Open up your eyes...</p>
   <p>JUDE<br>
   Dear Prudence, See the sunny skies
   The wind is low
   The birds will sing
   That you are part of everything
   Dear Prudence 
   Won't you open up your eyes?</p>
