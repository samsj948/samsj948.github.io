    <div class="conversation">   
		<p>David goes up to Rabbit Loner who’s shaving his face in the
river. He stares at him for a while then speaks loudly.</p>

<p>DAVID<br>
Afternoon. Is that a sparrow up in
that tree?</p>

<p>RABBIT LONER<br>
I can’t really see that far, but I
don’t think so.</p>

<p>DAVID<br>
Are you shortsighted?</p>

<p>RABBIT LONER<br>
No.</p>

<p>DAVID<br>
You’re lying.</p>

<p>RABBIT LONER<br>
It’s the truth.</p>

<p>DAVID<br>
What does it say here?
David shows him the zip on his jacket.</p>

<p>RABBIT LONER<br>
YKK.</p>
<p>DAVID
You knew that already. All zips say the same thing.</p>

<p>RABBIT LONER<br>
I’m not shortsighted. I don’t
understand why you won’t believe
me. I can see very clearly. I used
to be a pilot.</p>

<p>DAVID<br>
You’re wearing contact lenses.
</p>
<p>RABBIT LONER<br>
I’m not wearing contact lenses. I’m
not shortsighted, I swear.</p>
<p>DAVID<br>
You are. You think I’m an idiot and
can’t tell.
David hits him, kicks him and pins him down. He pulls open
his eyelids.<br>
Look up. I said, look up.
Rabbit Loner obeys. David fingers his eyeballs to check
whether he’s wearing contact lenses or not.
Now down. Left and right.
David gets up. Rabbit Loner stays down on the ground.</p>
<p>DAVID<br>
I’m sorry. I thought you were
trying to fool me. I’m sorry.
95 EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
David and Shortsighted Woman put CDs into their portable
players. Beside them stands a pony, it might be that girl
from the hotel.</p>
<p>DAVID<br>
We need to concentrate, we both
have to press play at the same
time. I’ll count down from five and
we’ll push the button on zero.
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
The both push their buttons and dance in each other’s arms.
We hear the same song playing twice, overlaid, the two
streams a little out of sync.
96 EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING
During the voice over, we see various scenes from the lives
of the loners.
66.</p>
<p>Loners watching a do g attacking a seal in the middle of the
woods, a loner fighting with another loner, a loner lying
dead, loners washing themselves in the river, Loner Leader
feeding the pig.</p>

<p>FEMALE V.O. </p>
		
		<p>We developed a code so that we can communicate with each other even in front of the others without them knowing what we are saying. When we turn our heads to the left it means "I love you more than anything in the world" and when we turn our heads to the right it means "watch out, we're in danger". We had to be very careful in the beginning not to mix up "I love you more than anything in the world" with "watch out, we're in danger". When we raise our left arm it means "I want to dance in your arms", when we make a fist and put it behind our backs it means "let's fuck". The code grew and grew as time went by and within a few weeks we could talk about almost anything without even opening our mouths.</p>
