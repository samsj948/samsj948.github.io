		<p>Mr. Thompson said, “Can I help you?”</p>
<p>I said, “Do you know who killed Wellington?”</p>
<p>I did not look at his face. I do not like looking at people’s faces, especially if they are
strangers. He did not say anything for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Then he said, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>I said, “I’m Christopher Boone from number 36 and I know you. You’re Mr. Thompson.”
He said, “I’m Mr. Thompson’s brother.”</p>
<p>I said, “Do you know who killed Wellington?”</p>
<p>He said, “Who the fuck is Wellington?”</p>
<p>I said, “Mrs. Shears’s dog. Mrs. Shears is from number 41.”</p>
<p>He said, “Someone killed her dog?”</p>
<p>I said, “With a fork.”</p>
<p>He said, “Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>I said, “A garden fork,” in case he thought I meant a fork you eat your food with. Then I said,
“Do you know who killed him?”</p>
<p>He said, “I haven’t a bloody clue.”</p>
<p>I said, “Did you see anything suspicious on Thursday evening?”</p>
<p>He said, “Look, son, do you really think you should be going around asking questions like
this?”</p>
<p>And I said, “Yes, because I want to find out who killed Wellington, and I am writing a book
about it.”</p>
<p>And he said, “Well, I was in Colchester on Thursday, so you’re asking the wrong bloke.”</p>
<p>I said, “Thank you,” and I walked away.
There was no answer at house number 42.
I had seen the people who lived at number 44, but I did not know what their names were.
They were black people and they were a man and a lady with two children, a boy and a girl. The
lady answered the door. She was wearing boots which looked like army boots and there were 5
bracelets made out of a silver-colored metal on her wrist and they made a jangling noise.</p>
