   <div class="conversation">
   
  <p> Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak.</p>
<p>‘You can’t!’ he said weakly.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean by that remark, Winston?’</p>
<p>‘You could not create such a world as you have just described. It is a dream. It is impossible.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred
and cruelty. It would never endure.’</p>
<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would
commit suicide.’</p>
<p>‘Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is
more exhausting than love. Why should it be? And if it were,
what difference would that make? Suppose that we choose
to wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that we quicken the
tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what
difference would it make? Can you not understand that the
death of the individual is not death? The party is immortal.’</p>
<p>As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his
disagreement O’Brien would twist the dial again. And yet
he could not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments, with
nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of
what O’Brien had said, he returned to the attack.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know—I don’t care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.’
‘We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imagining that there is something called human nature which
will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But
we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable. Or
perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out
of your mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity
is the Party. The others are outside—irrelevant.’</p>
<p>‘I don’t care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later
they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear
you to pieces.’</p>
