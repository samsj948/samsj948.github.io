    	<p>She looks at him really hard for a long moment. Joel tries
 		to hold her gaze, but can't. He looks down at his drink.
 		Clementine starts to cry again.</p>
 		
		 <p>CLEMENTINE<br>
 		You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled
		 at you before about it. God, I'm
		 dreadful.</p>
		 
 		<p>JOEL<br>
 		I have a tendency to use that word too
 		much. It is a little nondescript.</p>
 		
 		<p>CLEMENTINE<br>
		 I like you. That's the thing about my
		 psychic thing. I think that's my
		 greatest psychic power, that I get a
		 sense about people. My problem is I
		 never trust it. But I get it. And with
		 you I get that you're a really good guy.</p>
		 
		<p>JOEL<br>
		 Thanks.</p>
		 
		<p>CLEMENTINE<br>
 		And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I
 		can tell. There's a lot of stuff going
		 on in your brain. I can tell. My
		 goal... can I tell you my goal?</p>
		 
		 <p>JOEL<br>
		 (mock put out)
		 Yeah, I guess.</p>
		 
 		<p>CLEMENTINE<br>
		(ala Paul Simon)
		What's the goal, Joel?
		 (laughs)
		 My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
		 through me? Do you know what I mean?
		 It's like, there's all these emotions and
		 ideas and they come quick and they change
		 and they leave and they come back in a
		 different form and I think we're all
 		taught we should be consistent. Y'know?
 		You love someone -- that's it. Forever.
		 You choose to do something with your life
		 -- that's it, that's what you do.
		
 		It's a sign of maturity to stick with
 		that and see things through. And my
 		feeling is that's how you die, because
		 you stop listening to what is true, and
 		what is true is constantly changing. You
		 know?</p>

		<p>JOEL<br>
		 Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --</p>
		 
 		<p>CLEMENTINE<br>
		 Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't
 		need any more reason to do it. Who knows
 		what bigger cosmic reason might exist?</p>
 		
 		<p>JOEL<br>
		 Yeah.</p>
		 
		<p>CLEMENTINE<br>
 		I'm gonna marry you! I know it!</p>
 		
 		<p>JOEL<br>
		Um, okay.</p>
