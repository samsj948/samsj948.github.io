    <div class="conversation">
    	<p>"You know. The mummies--them dead guys. That get buried in them toons and
		all."</p>
		<p>Toons. That killed me. He meant tombs.</p>
		<p>"How come you two guys aren't in school?" I said.</p>
		<p>"No school t'day," the kid that did all the talking said. He was lying, sure as I'm
		alive, the little bastard. I didn't have anything to do, though, till old Phoebe showed up, so
		I helped them find the place where the mummies were. Boy, I used to know exactly
		where they were, but I hadn't been in that museum in years.</p>
		<p>"You two guys so interested in mummies?" I said.</p>
		<p> "Yeah."</p>
		<p>"Can't your friend talk?" I said.</p>
		<p>"He ain't my friend. He's my brudda."</p>
		<p>"Can't he talk?" I looked at the one that wasn't doing any talking. "Can't you talk
		at all?" I asked him.</p>
		<p>"Yeah," he said. "I don't feel like it."</p>
		<p>Finally we found the place where the mummies were, and we went in.</p>
		<p>"You know how the Egyptians buried their dead?" I asked the one kid.</p>
		 <p>"Naa."</p>
		<p>"Well, you should. It's very interesting. They wrapped their faces up in these
		cloths that were treated with some secret chemical. That way they could be buried in their
		tombs for thousands of years and their faces wouldn't rot or anything. Nobody knows
		how to do it except the Egyptians. Even modern science."</p>
		<p>To get to where the mummies were, you had to go down this very narrow sort of
		hall with stones on the side that they'd taken right out of this Pharaoh's tomb and all. It
		was pretty spooky, and you could tell the two hot-shots I was with weren't enjoying it too
		much. They stuck close as hell to me, and the one that didn't talk at all practically was
		holding onto my sleeve. "Let's go," he said to his brother. "I seen 'em awreddy. C'mon,
		hey." He turned around and beat it.</p>
		<p>"He's got a yella streak a mile wide," the other one said. "So long!" He beat it too. 
		I was the only one left in the tomb then. I sort of liked it, in a way. It was so nice
		and peaceful. Then, all of a sudden, you'd never guess what I saw on the wall. Another
		".... you." It was written with a red crayon or something, right under the glass part of
		the wall, under the stones.</p>
		<p>That's the whole trouble. You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful,
		because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're
		not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write ".... you" right under your nose. Try it
		sometime. I think, even, if I ever die, and they stick me in a cemetery, and I have a
		tombstone and all, it'll say "Holden Caulfield" on it, and then what year I was born and
		what year I died, and then right under that it'll say ".... you." I'm positive, in fact.
		After I came out of the place where the mummies were, I had to go to the bathroom. I sort of had diarrhea, if you want to know the truth. I didn't mind the diarrhea
		part too much, but something else happened. When I was coming out of the can, right
		before I got to the door, I sort of passed out. I was lucky, though. I mean I could've killed
		myself when I hit the floor, but all I did was sort of land on my side. it was a funny thing,
		though. I felt better after I passed out. I really did. My arm sort of hurt, from where I fell but I didn't feel so damn dizzy any more. </p>
