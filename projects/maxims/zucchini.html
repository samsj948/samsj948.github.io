    <p>ZUCCHINI<br>Come on</p>
    <p>ZUCCHINI<br>I got you a present. For your birthday.</p>
    <p>CAMILLE<br>But my birthday was three months ago!</p>
    <p>ZUCCHINI<br>I know. But.. We didn't know each other back then. So I couldn't have
    made you a gift. Here</p>
    <p>CAMILLE<br>Wow, how'd you know my birthday was three months ago?</p>
    <p>ZUCCHINI<br>I sort of snuck into Mis Papineau's office.</p>
    <p>CAMILLE<br>So you know everything. All right, then.</p>
    <p>ZUCCHINI<br>Well, I... yeah</p>
    <p>CAMILLE<br>After my parents died, I went to live with my aunt. She's the one who brought me here.
    She pretends to be so nice, but she's just cruel. She's always yelling at me. But now,
    this feels like home.</p>
    <p> ZUCCHINI<br>Sometimes, I dream that my mom's alive. And I'm all grown up. She keeps talking at the 
    TV and drinking beer. And in the dream, I drink a lot, too. That's why I'm glad I was brought
    here. That won't happen. </p>
    <p>CAMILLE<br>I'm happy I was brought here. Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you.</p>
