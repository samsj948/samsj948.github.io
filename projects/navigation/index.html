 			<img src="assets/imgs/mariano2.png" alt="Screengrab of Mariano Pascual portfolio page">
 			<p> This website is a portfolio site for Mariano Pascual.</p>
 			<p> The webpage mimics a desktop with a dock at the bottom and different windows
 			popping up. One feature I enjoyed was when you click on browser it comes up
 			with a search engine and then a whole bunch of ads. Each icon brings the user new options,
 			it is rather straight forward with how one navigates through the page since it is familiar. 
 			You can even customize the background and other options by going into settings.

 			<p> This website is a game called Spot the Spot. </p>
 			<p> The purpose of the website is to find the spot by resizing the window. There
 			is a simple button to start the game. After you resize the window until the 
 			current height and width turn green the spot shows up and you click on it to do it 
 			again. </p>
