	<div class="box" id="q8">
		<div class="question">
			Who are you when no one is looking?
		</div>
	
		<div class="answer">
			Myself<br>
			The complete opposite of what people think I am<br>
			Reserved but silly<br>
			Anxious, lazy, thoughtful, kind to strangers, lover of warmth, constantly trying to find myself.<br>
			Mostly content<br>
			A raw version of myself<br>
			A heavily contemplative individual who just wants to love and be loved<br>
			I'm a lot sadder<br>
			Free<br>
			I kind of just turn off the facade and lay around all the time and I’m depressed instead of happy and I try to show my happiness when people are around.<br>
			Not the person I wish I was<br>
			My true calm self<br>
			When no one is looking I am the same as when being looked at<br>
			Not a human! Not sure if I actually exist unless people are actively engaging with my personality.<br>
			I talk to myself a lot when I am alone. I shake and move a lot, and stop when I see someone staring.<br>
			Someone who is passionate about music and writing and might not share that with everyone. some one who is more quiet and in her head then i may seem from when i am in public.<br>
			I don’t know that it is possible to truly answer this, even when the physical presence of a human being is not involved we are stil culturally inclined to align to the standards we have been repeatedly shown.<br>
			My favorite version of myself<br>
			All the versions of myself that others see combined. Every facet of my personality is together and understood by me because I am the only person who has experienced every moment of my life. But also I have less energy and get sad more easily because I’m an extrovert.<br>
			Me but more dull<br>
			Myself ! calm<br>
			I think the same person as I normally am, maybe a little more true to myself.<br>
			Completely comfortable<br>
			My truest self. Though usually I forgot that anyone is watching.<br>
			I am pretty positive seeing the glass half full sometimes I get anxious and think too much but I usually get over that and realize who tf I am!!<br>
			I am my own child who is just full of love and silliness and energy.<br>
			Upset with how grocery stores have the audacity to sell frozen blueberries for $2.99 but fresh ones for $5.99, livid<br>
			An alien<br>
			When no one is looking, I am a confident, generally happy person who truly wants to help those around her and contribute positivity to her surroundings.<br>
			I am my most comfortable self. I am full of love, confidence, humor, honesty, happiness, contentment, etc.<br>
			Empty.<br>
			Me<br>
			Free<br>
			The same as usual but way more distracted and in my own world<br>
			A vessel seeking knowledge and guidance<br>
			Honest<br>
			Im emotionally vulnerable and insecure, but content with who I am. I understand I’m young and will never stop growing.<br>
			I don’t know and that might be the worst part<br>
			Happy<br>
			The same as when they are looking<br>
			My complete kinda weird self<br>
			I think I am very much less 'formed' in the sense that I am not necessarily shaping my thoughts or actions for a specific context. I usually look the furthest outward (into trees and the sky and anything else) when I am not being seen, and yet find it easiest in this space to find an internal balance. I'd like to think that my personal values and desire to add meaningful good to the world, whatever that might mean at the given moment, stay relatively consistent regardless of if someone is looking or not. That is not to say that I do not desire change or growth, which are both ironically constant in being things that I pursue regardless of if someone is looking or not.<br>
			I don’t know, I feel like someone has always been looking so I tend to be caught up with upholding others expectation of me. I like to think that I am funny, warm, welcoming, kind, a little crazy, and creative.<br>
			An introvert who’s always trying to fill their time and figure out what all this is about<br>
			Many things<br>
			Walled in<br>
			My complete self. A lover of a lot of different things. Happy. Content. Silly<br>
			Tired, creative, sensual, musical, and sensitive.<br>
			I'm a more vulnerable version of myself. I overthink a lot and the thoughts that often cross my mind are the ones I am afraid to show. I usually address them when no one is looking. When no one is looking, I am unapologetically me. The positive me as well as someone who's trying to deal with the baggage life throws her way. When you're with people you want to have an exterior and seem sorted but really you're just like everyone else.<br>
			Truthfully, I’m not sure<br>
			My boss ass bitch self<br>
			Sensitive and Determined<br>
			I’m a slightly more relaxed version of myself, but overall I’m the same as when people are looking.<br>
			A sensitive and lost<br>
			Myself i don’t know how to be anyone else as cheesy as it sounds. I never allow myself to change for anyone and that’s hard but that’s something i have been working on the past year. lncluding changing for myself when no one is looking.<br>
			I am a chill girl who is somewhat lazy and just watches Netflix all day<br>
			I’m the same person just a bit more free.<br>
			I don’t know<br>
			The same person<br>
			Boring yet sometimes spontaneous??<br>
			I am someone who cares and hopes for the best<br>
			A free spirit<br>
			I’m like a rat<br>
			Someone i'm proud to be, someone who isn't afraid to stand up for themselves. Someone who I want to be when nobody is watching as well as when people are.<br>
			A self-conscious narcissist<br>
			I think I am myself<br>
			Quiet, really really quiet. And scared of lots of the big things in the world.<br>
			Headphones in, music on.<br>
			Kind of like a neutral person I guess? i don’t do anything too exciting, usually just consume the office on loop and lie in bed like a lifeless body. or fall asleep.<br>
			I am someone who likes to watch and listen, and use the outside world to better understand myself. I constantly try to figure out who I am. I worry about small interactions and the people affected by them. I like to perform art! much more than I let on. I walk really fast when I'm alone, and like to go to crowded places and just be with myself. I binge eat and procrastinate. I internalize and distract myself from my own problems. I never take a break.<br>
			A sloth<br>
			Quiet and thoughtful<br>
			Lost soul avoiding the monotony of life<br>
			A soft girl.<br>
			Practicing to be the person I want to be.<br>
			A girl singing loud in her car trying to figure shit out<br>
			Not much different from how I am when people are looking, just less interesting<br>
			Truly myself.<br>
			A much more introspective version of myself<br>
			I am someone who is constantly analyzing my life for flaws to fix, wether within myself or externally, so that I can become the idea of perfect. Which I know at the end of the day, is impossible for anyone to achieve. And only when success and perfection are achieved within my life can I truly be happy and content.<br>
			I am the same person as I am around my closest friends.<br>
			My true self. Relaxed, funny, weird, outgoing, free of any societal pressures.<br>
			My true self. Relaxed, funny, weird, free from all societal pressures and able to be who I really am.<br>
			Sensitive, Caring, I put others before myself; no one takes the time to see that<br>
			Soft<br>
			I don’t think I’m a significantly different person in public and in private. There certainly isn’t anything that I can’t share with at least one other person, if if that’s just my mum. I think generally I’m a pretty open person, I don’t have any skeletons in the closet.<br>
			A mess<br>
			A really lazy person<br>
			Too high to answer this, but that is an answer in and of itself.<br>
			When no one is looking, i feel as though there’s less of a pressure for me to look and act the way i tend to in public, with people i feel comfortable with. i’d say that i have different personalities for the different groups i’m with, i.e my parents, my school friends, my outside of school friends.<br>
			Hopefully a good person<br>
			A weirder version of the “normal” me<br>
			Unsure<br>
			My saddest self<br>
			I am an amazing dancer, laughing in the rain, and I can talk to wildlife. I am creative and a perfectionist and secretly think I could be an amazing spy.<br>
			Myself<br>
			Pretty lazy, and more sad than the silly and happy person people consistently see me as. But I’m working on it and things are improving and when I’m alone with only my judgement, I’m pretty proud of who I am and what I’m capable of.<br>
			An Athlete<br>
			Nicolas cage<br>
			Me<br>
			Emotional, happy & scared.<br>
			Quiet, content, a bit anxious<br>
			When no one is looking I tend to think a lot to myself and take a total turn from my usual extroverted self. It’s kind of a time for me to think about myself and get my own thoughts in order. <br>
			More humble than expected <br>
			Hopeless romantic<br>
			Myself.<br>
			Sleeping, and a complete goof. I dance and singer louder than imaginable when I’m alone.<br>
