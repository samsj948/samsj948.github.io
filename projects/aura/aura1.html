I usually look the furthest outward (into trees and the sky and anything else) when I am not being seen, and yet find it easiest in this space to find an internal balance. I'd like to think that my personal values and desire to add meaningful good to the world, whatever that might mean at the given moment, stay relatively consistent regardless of if someone is looking or not. That is not to say that I do not desire change or growth, which are both ironically constant in being things that I pursue regardless of if someone is looking or not. </span>
