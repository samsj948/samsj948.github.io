  		It was a/an <span class="word word-adjective-1"></span> and stormy night in fairyland. A night just perfect for witches. With fairy godmother in the clink, I began to wonder if we were ready for a world turned <span class="word word-adjective-2"></span>. Sweet witches and friendly wolves. Wise wizards and princesses with pig noses making art with <span class="word word-artSupply"></span>. It's a world gone mad but somehow things are looking sunny-side up and we may find some kind of happily ever after in fairytale land.

I knew she was trouble and I told her so. I told her she was like one of those <span class="word word-pluralNoun3"></span> that scramble your brains like, "what came first, the <span class="word word-noun2"></span> or the egg?"
