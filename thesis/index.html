  			<h1>From the People</h1>
  			<p>100 letters to 100 senators. Starting with handmaking the paper from old scraps of projects, bills, newspapers, and more. Reusing what was meant to be discarded and turning it into something new. The Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth is then handwritten on this paper. Each letter has its own imperfections, its own bumps and bruises. All held together by the Earth, our home.</p>
